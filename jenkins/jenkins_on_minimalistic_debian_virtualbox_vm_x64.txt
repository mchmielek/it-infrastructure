A Jenkins build server (LTS release) can now be easily installed on the minimalistic Debian VM:

    Download and install Virtualbox
    Download debian-stable-amd64-minimal.ova (http://dev.doepner.net/dist/vms/debian-stable-amd64-minimal.ova) and import it into Virtualbox
    Start the “debian-stable-amd64-minimal” VM in Virtualbox
    Review debian-stable-amd64-minimal.txt and adjust locale, timezone and Debian mirror based on your location
    Start an ssh session to localhost, port 1111 (using PuTTY, for example)
    Log in as user (default password is “user”)
    Issue “sudo install.sh jenkins” (default root password is “root”)
    Press enter for any questions during installation
    Open http://localhost:8888/ in a browser on the host OS for Jenkins web ui

You can go to “Manage Jenkins” – “Configure System” and see that JDK, Ant and Maven entries are already configured for you.

Both OpenJDK 6 and OpenJDK 7 are installed automatically for you in the VM. Please note that openjdk-6 is the Debian stable system default, while openjdk-7 is configured as the default for Jenkins build jobs.

Important: Make sure to change root and user passwords to something secure, as mentioned in debian-stable-amd64-minimal.txt.
